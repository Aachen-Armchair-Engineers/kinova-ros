Kinova is moving forward. Now we have Jaco and Mico arms, and there will be more products coming up soon. The ROS package originally developed for Jaco arm (Jaco-ROS) on current master branch, does not satisfy this expansion. Further development based on Jaco-ROS for Mico arm already shows its limitation. The inappropriate notation deteriorates the code framework and confuses developers&users as well. Therefore, we are re-factoring the code to support better our current and future products(Kinova-ROS). The re-factoring starts with a renaming of current code (namespace, class, function, etc.) while keeping the same structure and content. Later on, the structure and content will be modified to provide a general framework with different robot model as one of the input parameters.

Meanwhile, the master branch of Jaco-ROS will be saved as a new branch with name "Jaco-ROS". Developers can still use Jaco-ROS to develop their own applications and run for Jaco and Mico. However, new features update / request merge will be available only on Kinova-ROS.

***

TBD for renaming from jaco-ros to kinova-ros:

 - the file to access arm from usb doesnot updated yet, since it might not be recognized if its name changes. Corresponding name might need to change in the file in low communication level.
 the file is located in:
<catkin_workspace>/src/kinova-ros/kinova_driver/udev/99-kinova-arm.rules

- names in  KINOVA.API.*(CommLayerUbuntu.h, UsbCommandLayerUbuntu.h) and KinovaTypes.h are not renamed.

- urdf files may dedicated for different robot arm model, or may use a general form with robot model as a parameter. TBD

- launch file leaves same as urdf file.
