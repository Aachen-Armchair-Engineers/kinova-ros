Kinova is moving forward. Now we have Jaco and Mico arms, and there will be more products coming up soon. The ROS package originally developed for Jaco arm (Jaco-ROS) on current master branch, does not satisfy this expansion. Further development based on Jaco-ROS for Mico arm already shows its limitation. The inappropriate notation deteriorates the code framework and confuses developers&users as well. Therefore, we are re-factoring the code to support better our current and future products(Kinova-ROS). The re-factoring starts with a renaming of current code (namespace, class, function, etc.) while keeping the same structure and content. Later on, the structure and content will be modified to provide a general framework with different robot model as one of the input parameters.

Meanwhile, the master branch of Jaco-ROS will be saved as a new branch with name "Jaco-ROS". Developers can still use Jaco-ROS to develop their own applications and run for Jaco and Mico. However, new features update / request merge will be available only on Kinova-ROS.

***

TBD for renaming from kinova-ros to kinova-ros:

- names in  KINOVA.API.*(CommLayerUbuntu.h, UsbCommandLayerUbuntu.h) and KinovaTypes.h are not renamed.

- urdf files may dedicated for different robot arm model, or may use a general form with robot model as a parameter. TBD

- launch file leaves same as urdf file.
